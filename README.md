# Guess the Number On-Chain

## 📜 Project Description

This project is a **decentralized, on-chain implementation** of the classic **Guess the Number** game, built using the **Clarity smart contract language** and deployed on the **Stacks Testnet**.

The contract allows a game owner to **secretly choose a number**, while players attempt to guess it. The smart contract **validates guesses** and responds with hints (**too high, too low, or correct**) — all enforced transparently **on-chain**.

No centralized server is needed — the **entire game logic lives on the blockchain**.

## 🔭 Project Vision

The vision behind this project is to demonstrate how even **simple and fun games** can be brought **fully on-chain** using Clarity. With **trustless validation** and **deterministic rules**, players can interact with **verifiable outcomes** directly on the Stacks blockchain.

This project aims to:

- **Showcase Clarity smart contracts** as a beginner-friendly entry into on-chain gaming.
- **Inspire developers** to gamify blockchain interactions in creative ways.
- **Lay the groundwork** for building more advanced on-chain entertainment experiences.

## ⭐ Key Features

- 🎲 **Start Game**: Owner sets a secret number (within a chosen range).
- 🤔 **Make a Guess**: Players submit a guess, and the contract checks it.
- ⬆️ **Higher or Lower Hint**: Players receive **on-chain hints** for incorrect guesses.
- 🏆 **Winning Guess**: Correct player is declared as the **winner** by the contract.
- 🔐 **Fully On-Chain**: All **state and logic** (secret number, guesses, results) are stored on-chain.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- 💰 **Prize Pool**: Add STX or token rewards for correct guesses.
- ⏳ **Timed Challenges**: Introduce a maximum number of guesses or time limit.
- 🏅 **Leaderboard**: Track winners and create rankings.
- 🎨 **Front-End UI**: Build a simple React interface using Stacks.js for a fun UX.
- 🪙 **NFT Rewards**: Mint NFTs as proof of winning using **SIP-009 standard**.
- 🔢 **Dynamic Ranges**: Allow custom ranges (e.g., 1–1000) for added difficulty.
